# ML_Recommendation_Model
The model recommends a set of books to user based on Machine Learning Techniques

Algorithm:- Latent Factor Model for Collaborative Filtering

Optimization Technique:- Stochastic Gradient Descent

Steps--

1) Analyze the data

2) Construct a rating matrix

3) Initialize factor matrices

4) Compute the error using RMSE

5) Minimize error using SGD

6) Save the output in the form of MXN matrix, where M is the number of users and N is the number of books where each entry rij represents the rating of product j for a given user i. A higher rating indicates that the user is more likely to purchase a product.
